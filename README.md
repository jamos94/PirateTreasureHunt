# PirateTreasureHunt
CS-370 AI and Emerging Trends in CS: An agent (pirate) learns the best path to find the hidden treasure. 


    Through throughout this course, I have worked with given source code. I have added an intelligent agent (pirate). Also, I used a Q-Training Algorithm seto develop       code which leads the pirate to the treasure. Deep Q-learning algorithm is used to solve the pathfinding problem.
    
    My learning in this class can relate to the larger feild of computer science in many ways. 
    1. Computer scientist build software, analyze hardware, create and utilize          algorithms to solve problems and much more. The study of computer science matters because computers and systems have been integrated into almost every aspect of business, the economy, personal, and much more. 
    2. Approaching problems as a computer scientist can be complex, yet simple. It's important for first understand what the problem is and then brain storm solutions. Defining the problem allows the computer scientist to determine the bet fit remedy. Once a remedy is chosen, a solution is implemented and then tests are ran to ensure the validity of the solution. 
    3. Being aware of ethical responsibilities is essential in every field of career and education. However, for computer scientists, we must ensure high ethics throughout many aspects of our work. For developers, we must ensure the code we have built is not something that will cause harm, distress, or have negative intentions for the end users.
